I have a stick that is not been used in a while. I'm wanting to use my stick again. I'm looking for a woman that has a hole for my stick. I'm not concerned about the age of the whole or how it looks around the whole, in fact I prefer just an average hole. I just need a hold to put the stick into.
Thanks!

Hit me up if you know who you are.

You were there this morning in the blue shorts.  That was a beautiful showing.  Made adjustments at certain times.  Thought we'd connect?

WOW, from the moment I seen you smile I haven‚Äôt been able to get you out of my head . I highly doubt you see this but I thought you should know how beautiful you are. -J

Im the cash-app guy

You were standing in the shade. It took me about half a minute to notice you were waiting on your boyfriend to finish repairing his motorized üõµ. Although I noticed the opportunity to swoop in. Taken advantage of someone else's misfortune is in my nature but if y'all aren't dating. I would like my chance to date you. I am the tall guy who waved bye to you.

I'm looking for a date to state fair I'm a 25 year old Hispanic male I'm looking for a male or female I will pay 21+

Hope you see this and reply.

Been kicking myself all day for not asking for your number

You were buying food but went to the wrong location. You helped me with the door. I should have bought you a tequila.

Keep getting flagged

Keep flagging. We're having more fun with your mom

Who besides me enjoys the monster dogs at Costco? Especially when you put a ton of tasty sauce on top ..

I miss talking to you. The conversations we used to have. The way you made me laugh. You are such a kind sweet man. That is what this woman really liked about you. You were always so respectful and thoughtful of me. Wish I could see you again. Hope things are well for you.

Hit me up! 97 zero two3one738six

It‚Äôs Trinity from XlŒøcally. Just was hoping you can find some time away from her and give me a call.

Your my waitress this morning dressed in black i was flirtatious and even came back in asking if i left somthing on my table. Hmu if you wanna chat n see if we click. What did i ask about or what color was your belt ?

We were both looking for potatoes...lol. wanted to say hi but I was just shy. Kinda felt a connection with you and think we could talk and maybe make something happen... I hope you see this and get back to me...

You came up to me in target gave me some line about how cute I was. I was w my little one and you leaned over whispered something to me that made me blush.....just wanted you to know I'm still thinking about it. Thanks. You really were cute.

I was in Monday night and sat at the bar. I hadn‚Äôt been there before.  You were so friendly and adorable.  I wanted to get your contact information, but it got a bit crowded and I didn‚Äôt want to do that in front of everyone. I‚Äôd like to talk more.

We flew from Eugene to Las Vegas. I went on to Santa Barbara and you went on to Colorado Springs. You were coming back from a ladies trip and are planning another road trip riding a motorcycle in the mountains. We talked all the way from EUG to LAS. This is a long long shot but would love to talk some more about your adventures. I didn‚Äôt get your name but you‚Äôre a retired educator I believe ‚Ä¶ if you read this needle in a haystack message. Please reply.

I hope to see you again.

This is a long shot, but I saw you at Dutch bros in fountain this morning. I was there with my room mate grabbing coffee from the walk up window, and you were waiting for your order from the window. You had a flight for life vest on and drove off in a pretty truck. I looked homeless in my pjs‚Ä¶ black shorts, grey sweatshirt, ponytail, and lots of tattoos. Anyways, you‚Äôre handsome and I hope you‚Äôre single!

Was at Top Golf you asked me about my best club, I told you and you were interested in learning more

We stood by each other at the Fred Again show. You told me you liked how I danced and gave me a piece of gum. Really wish I would have asked more about you.

You approached me and I looked for you later to give you my card, but I couldn‚Äôt find you.

Im a male who wae in target you were a woman looking at a tv and it took them forever to take care of you. You were in leather leggings very tight but I admired you. I kept running into you when I was about to approach you I got a call and had to run. Please reach out. We locked eyes couple times but I found you stunning Hope you see this.

F 37 Aquarius looking for intelligent and interesting conversation. M or F. Married. Reply with age gender and zodiac sign. Not looking to hook up. Hit me up.

Hmu if ya wanna continue

We were at neighboring gates.  I‚Äôm from a west coast state and you were heading home to Vegas with your son. You‚Äôre both blonde. I had a specific comment about your luggage. What characters are on the luggage?!

Hi, I was at the Kings near Buckley and Smoky Hill and I hurt my back a bit and you helped put the groceries in my car.  Wished I could have given you a proper thank you but I was wincing a bit.

I commented you were eating healthy . You're beautiful !! Let's chat if u see this üëÄ

You helped me and my hubby find an eye patch for our daughter. I felt like we were vibing, and really enjoyed your energy.I have  dark hair like you. My hubby had a sleeve and you had a few tattoos yourself‚Ä¶just putting this out to the universe in hopes it finds you.

I arrived around 11 and went to bar after putting a song in for karaoke. You came up to order drink and I initiated a conversation, then got my drink and left. Al night I regretted it because you left soon after you finished your drink. I was pretty sure you were into me. And I was definitely into you: black guy with some facial hair. If you see this come back to the Outback next weekend.

You have long black hair, and a rocker-ish look. If you do read these- what color is my hair? so I know it's actually you...

You were behind the bar and made me a great drink. We chatted a bit. I said I was a little ‚Äú overdressed‚Äù and your very nice comment made me smile. This older guy would love to meet again and buy you a drink.

We met a few years back and I got to see your minivan. Then found out our kids are into the same sports and never reconnected. If you see this and are interested in reconnecting reach out.

I am a shy older man. It was October 1st early in the morning, at Uinta King Soopers.Your smile was awesome. I hope you see this, you made my day!

AB

You wanted me to bring you a rug but it started raining. We never exchanged numbers. Hit me up if you still want me to bring it by. Tell me how we met and what i keep forgetting and asking you about so i know its you.

I came in to pickup dinner in gray pants and an orange shirt.  You had Halloween leggings which showed off your amazing figure.  You also couldn‚Äôt quite say what you meant when you handed me my drink. Have a good night!

You were the rad chick who talked to me about the same Face to Face shirt. Sorry I didn‚Äôt stay to chat more. Let‚Äôs fix that.

Long shot here, but figured I‚Äôd try. I picked you up super early this morning. You were talking about how you were married and the business you do, then you hinted you might need a helping *hand* on a *job* you needed completed. I was too nervous to agree but I haven‚Äôt stopped thinking about it. Tell me what I looked like if this is you‚Ä¶

My wife and I were gambling at Monarch last night and when she walked away you made a comment about her I thought was inappropriate but now that I have thought it over I might be game for that.



Hit me up.

At St. Anthony's. I tried to give my seat to you. We both have scars. I think you're beautiful.

I deliver to where you work but never have the chance to talk to you as I'm always in a rush and you're always busy so it's a constant missed connection! Maybe this...

Why would anyone flag this? I thought this is what "missed connection" was for? Some people obviously got too much time on their hands!!

Hi Alex. I was at India Oven today but was told you are taking 2 weeks off. Will you be back there? Miss seeing you there. I go there for lunch Buffett and I like to sit away from the Buffett serving items. Sure you know me.

You helped me purchase a pair of sunglasses today. You were so very nice, and I enjoyed our conversation very much. I hesitated asking because you were at work. If by any chance you see this, I would love to take you to dinner. Have a great weekend!

I hope we can just start over.

I'll happily make your drink again.

Tuesday Arc in Loveland Woman in mustang, I was sitting with my dog. Wish I would have talked to you. Let's get together if you are interested?

First we almost bounced into each other outside the store. I should have let you go first but for some reason I went first and said sorry or something. Later we met inside the store. I helped you find the trash can. I'd love to chat more with you. Couldn't stop thinking about you this entire afternoon. Still can't.

I was pumping gas. Looked back and saw you smiling at me. You were gassing up a silver minivan with Nebraska plates. Wish I would have said hi.

I said you have beautiful hair. Wish I said more...

#7

What is my tattoo?

Did I feel a connection with you the door is open if you would be interested in stepping in. Tell me something only we would have known

So you were serving and compensated an order with orange chicken and smiled. I'd like to know you more than that! Maybe tell me where it happened and about me so I know. I just don't want to get you in trouble at work unless you don't care of course lol. I know you won't see this but tell me if I'm wrong.

I was driving north on Wadsworth at about Jewel and you were next to me in this nice black Jeep.  You were older Hispanic man and very cute. Just wanted to say hi.

We both get on at the same time and get off at the same stop.. I think you‚Äôre really cute but I can‚Äôt bring myself to speak up‚Ä¶ you walk to the 7/11 when you get off. Every morning.

I didn't get a chance to answer your question before our email chain was broken. I can't reply anymore. No more Swiss updates but one on the kid. It's a bit of a doozy.

Was behind you at Dickey's this evening (Sunday) at 4:30ish. You said you were treating yourself to dinner since the kids were at their dad's tonight. I should have chased you outside and got your number... Message me if you see this!

God I hope you see this

I was in your way while I was looking for some cheese and then you helped me look for the Havarti.  I should have given you the flowers in my basket!  If you happen to see this let me know.  I'd love to connect for an intro!

You were Traveling from Frankfurt/Germany/ to Denver, Colorado and I was going to Boston, Ma  on Sept.20, 2022.  Missed you

I know this is a long shot, I saw first sitting in the food court snd we made eye contact. You have the most beautiful eyes, then you walked behind me to the same gate. You were so stunning and beautiful, I wanted to say hello, but every time I look at you you took my breath away. As I went by you sitting in the plane, you looked up at me again and again I wanted to say hello. ÔøºÔøº I was wearing the orange shirt,Ôøº if you see this tell me what the logo was on your black shirt. I would love to get to know you! ÔøºÔøº

To the gorgeous and absolutely fit lady who was parked nose to nose from me today at the Safeway on 144th and Lowell- you know who you are.   We exchanged lingering looks and smiles but neither one of us went beyond that.  You drove away in your Audi.   Please reach out.  Tell me what I was driving!!

Saw you on CR 23. You were heading south as I was heading north. We locked eyes for a sec. You caught my attention so I pumped my brakes and you noticed. You turned back around saw me again but kept driving. You're a beautiful chocolate woman.  I hope you see this.

You were delivering packages and parked in front of my house. We had a very nice little chat and I gave you a neon vest so you could look more "legit" while delivering. I should have asked for your phone number. Lets hang out.. you can return the vest, I'm sure it's huge on you ;)

We exchanged a emails a few years ago. F4m‚Ä¶ you told me I should be at Sunday school for being in my 20s.

We both like to run and take care of ourselves which is more than most people have in common. Plus you're tall and beautiful and I'm... tall lol

I was walking home after ideal. You slowed down on your bike and told me that you thought I was cute and that you hope I have a good day. I‚Äôve never posted on here and you may never see this but I thought you were cute too and Ive never had a stranger say something so cute to me before that didn‚Äôt make me feel creeped out. Anyway. Have a good day, maybe we‚Äôll meet again and we can ride bikes together and do spooky things this season.

You we‚Äôre having trouble with your bike. In the position you were in I had to stop.  Got you good and fixed, and never asked for a number‚Ä¶doh!  Hope you see this.

Saw you smiling face. Nice and handsome. We smiled. Cheers. Wanted to say hello. Missed.

I was the man behind you in drive-thru and could see your face in your driver‚Äôs side mirror. You paid for my coffee. I couldn‚Äôt thank you because your drive away and my drink took sometime.

You were waiting in line as I was called up to get my picture taken. You gave the best flirty smile and I thought you were a very beautiful lady.. let me know what color hat and shirt I had on. It was around 1pm today..Would love to take you on a date..

Happened to see you again at King Soopers on Wednesday afternoon. You were with your kiddo so I did not want to say anything or be creepy (although I guess posting here could be considered creepy, LOL) You have shoulder length wavy blonde hair. Offer still stands from a few months ago. Let‚Äôs grab a latte. You are gorgeous.

I tried to talk to you but i kept missing the opportunity, we made eye contact a couple times, you are a sexy country girl in jeans. I am a taller guy average build. I would like to grab a beer and hang out or something if you see this.

I had door dashed at Walgreens a few nights ago. I came in and you instantly smiled and said hi. Showed me right where to go and checked me out. If you wanna talk, what did I get?

I was leaving and you were just going in just going in to Safeway we both smile at each other would love to chat.

Thursday afternoon. I was having coffee and you were with you're mom and her friend. We connected and both left the restaurant at the same time. Let's chat üôÇ

U were short with dark hair and dark eyes. Very beautiful. I was tall & scruffy. I wanted to compliment you on those eyes. But, nowadays it's hard to talk to ppl. We both waited 4ever for our food. I know it's a long shot, but wth.

I was out with a group yesterday and as we passed you said you wanted to workout with me. I couldn't really accepted a the time but I think I know why you asked. Write back with your description and which gym. I'd like to connect.

You are the stunning older woman in the workout outfit. You were loading groceries in the back of your car, we locked eyes. You made me stop in my tracks. If traffic wasn‚Äôt too bad, I would have introduced myself. I hope you see this, I hope we have a chance to talk.

Hope you see this.

This should be easy to remember. We were in the elevator at one of the DTC buildings and the elevator got stuck for 5 mins. You freaked out and I calmed you down. Happened last Tuesday. I was in business casual.Some muscles. Your are in your mid or low 30‚Äôs.

Unexpected fun until you ran away from me. Thanks for the moment.

Hey its R I'm trying to get a hold of you but lost your number if you see this send me a message

We made eye contact and I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to say Hi. I hope you see this! You are a beautiful lady!

I wanted to talk to you on OKC, but you disappeared.

We were in paint section. I could smell your old spice deodorant. You‚Äôre scruffy and muscular, I‚Äôm just a guy with average looks.

You were taking yourself for a walk and licked my left hand in greeting. Let me know if you want to hang out sometime

You: Handsome Latino with tattoos and septum piercing.  We were both leaving at the same time on Monday 9/19 around 8:15PM.  Let me know if you see this.

Thank You

I pointed the door dash driver to your building and talked to you on the phone. You were very patient and kind. I hope he found your building.

Looking for a male friend to hang out with.

You were wearing your NASA shirt and looked so cute and intelligent. I was on a boring date, we sat in same row and stood in line next to each other. I‚Äôd like to know you.

You were the beautiful lady getting gas then putting air in her tires last night. You were in a black car and have curly hair and had on tie dye shorts.. I was in black Ford Raptor truck. We exchanged a few glances and smiles and I'm kicking myself for not saying hello.. hopefully this finds you..

If you‚Äôre you and you remember me, you‚Äôll remember what kind of guitar I bought ‚Äî put it in the subject line.

-B

You were very handsome and made me nervous, plus my dog was barking at you and I felt bad. Not sure if that was your man with you, but you were both handsome. Let‚Äôs chat if you see this.

think we caught each other's glance a couple times... you were with people but i wished you were alone so we could have chatted.

You absolutely took my breath away. We chatted some. This is a long shot, but if you see this and felt the same way, I am your man.

We had decent conversation.   I should of walked you back.  Still up?

Anyone want to make some friendly wagers on any games this season

Best wishes, Mare

You helped me pick out a gundam let me know what I look like or what gundam I got‚Ä¶ I would love to build with you sometime

We talked for a few minutes and I felt a connection.  I will be out of town for a week, so I won‚Äôt have a chance to ‚Äúrun into you‚Äù.  If you respond, I will be able to email.  Would love to get to know you better, you were very attractive and I am interested.

I'd like to reconnect...we met up a couple weeks ago and enjoyed a fun moment...ok a long moment...52yo male here...hmu if you see this...thanks

I‚Äôve never done this. I should‚Äôve asked you to out. Crossing my fingers‚Ä¶.

I should have come back to give you my phone number when I had the chance

Jon

Hanna, this is a special shoutout to you.  Not sure you're going to ever see this, but IF YOU DO, care to grab a drink sometime soon?  I must be transparent: I'm moving away at the end of the year, but think of all the fun we could have until then....

I am not sure if it was me or what I was wearing but tell me what it was and let's talk.

Bro. I kept it. and it was FIRE. -- please tell me the strain i literally think about this once a week

Sep 14 around 7:25 AM - you; golden boy shirtless runner looking incredible. thanks for the eye candy and making the walk a bit more enjoyable. Please no response unless you are this person.

You and I were racing down smoky hill towards southlands,  you turned north and waved at aurora parkway. What was I driving? Hope this finds you

-That guy

Pat - We met at right fit alterations and totally forgot to ask for your number. Never used this before but figured I‚Äôd try it! Mention something about our convo in your reply so I know it‚Äôs not some internet stranger lol.

Saw you at the bus stop today at 4:30. I was too shy to start a conversation but was checking you out. You are super cute and I should have asked you out

You and another person were at Meow Wolf today, Monday 9/12, in an adorable suspender dress. I complimented your bee purse and showed you my snail purse and called us twins. Later, we ran into each other in the Security Room and swapped tips for befriending slime. I didn't get a chance to say so but you seemed really cool and I would love to be friends. Hopefully our paths converge (see what I did there?) again.

The first time we crossed paths I was getting my Porsche checked. Today it was my truck. You made my day the first time with your smile. Today, again, you are still gorgeous. Just saying thanks for being the best part of my day.

Wished I'd have said more, you were in the BMW with the dog in the back.  Gorgeous.

We were both in are cars, smoking  cigarettes! I thought I saw you looking my way but there was a sum glair. I thought to get out and approach you but wasn‚Äôt sure until I backed up to leave and once I did you did the same and it was too late‚Ä¶.Would like a female to walk with!!

Hit me up if you know who you are.

You were there this morning in the blue shorts.  That was a beautiful showing.  Made adjustments at certain times.  Thought we'd connect?

WOW, from the moment I seen you smile I haven‚Äôt been able to get you out of my head . I highly doubt you see this but I thought you should know how beautiful you are. -J

Im the cash-app guy

You were standing in the shade. It took me about half a minute to notice you were waiting on your boyfriend to finish repairing his motorized üõµ. Although I noticed the opportunity to swoop in. Taken advantage of someone else's misfortune is in my nature but if y'all aren't dating. I would like my chance to date you. I am the tall guy who waved bye to you.

I'm looking for a date to state fair I'm a 25 year old Hispanic male I'm looking for a male or female I will pay 21+

To the beautiful absolutely stunning miss I saw today walking down main st in canyon  today wearing the pink dress, tan skin, you have my attention forsure !! I would love to see if you would be up for a date night !!!

I used to date you a few years ago. Havent seen or heard from you in a while. Would love to know how you're doing.  Hope you see this. T

Hope you see this and reply.

Been kicking myself all day for not asking for your number

You were buying food but went to the wrong location. You helped me with the door. I should have bought you a tequila.

Keep getting flagged

Keep flagging. We're having more fun with your mom

Who besides me enjoys the monster dogs at Costco? Especially when you put a ton of tasty sauce on top ..

I miss talking to you. The conversations we used to have. The way you made me laugh. You are such a kind sweet man. That is what this woman really liked about you. You were always so respectful and thoughtful of me. Wish I could see you again. Hope things are well for you.

Hit me up! 97 zero two3one738six

It‚Äôs Trinity from XlŒøcally. Just was hoping you can find some time away from her and give me a call.

Your my waitress this morning dressed in black i was flirtatious and even came back in asking if i left somthing on my table. Hmu if you wanna chat n see if we click. What did i ask about or what color was your belt ?

We were both looking for potatoes...lol. wanted to say hi but I was just shy. Kinda felt a connection with you and think we could talk and maybe make something happen... I hope you see this and get back to me...

You came up to me in target gave me some line about how cute I was. I was w my little one and you leaned over whispered something to me that made me blush.....just wanted you to know I'm still thinking about it. Thanks. You really were cute.

I was in Monday night and sat at the bar. I hadn‚Äôt been there before.  You were so friendly and adorable.  I wanted to get your contact information, but it got a bit crowded and I didn‚Äôt want to do that in front of everyone. I‚Äôd like to talk more.

We flew from Eugene to Las Vegas. I went on to Santa Barbara and you went on to Colorado Springs. You were coming back from a ladies trip and are planning another road trip riding a motorcycle in the mountains. We talked all the way from EUG to LAS. This is a long long shot but would love to talk some more about your adventures. I didn‚Äôt get your name but you‚Äôre a retired educator I believe ‚Ä¶ if you read this needle in a haystack message. Please reply.

I hope to see you again.

This is a long shot, but I saw you at Dutch bros in fountain this morning. I was there with my room mate grabbing coffee from the walk up window, and you were waiting for your order from the window. You had a flight for life vest on and drove off in a pretty truck. I looked homeless in my pjs‚Ä¶ black shorts, grey sweatshirt, ponytail, and lots of tattoos. Anyways, you‚Äôre handsome and I hope you‚Äôre single!

Was at Top Golf you asked me about my best club, I told you and you were interested in learning more

We stood by each other at the Fred Again show. You told me you liked how I danced and gave me a piece of gum. Really wish I would have asked more about you.

You approached me and I looked for you later to give you my card, but I couldn‚Äôt find you.

Im a male who wae in target you were a woman looking at a tv and it took them forever to take care of you. You were in leather leggings very tight but I admired you. I kept running into you when I was about to approach you I got a call and had to run. Please reach out. We locked eyes couple times but I found you stunning Hope you see this.

F 37 Aquarius looking for intelligent and interesting conversation. M or F. Married. Reply with age gender and zodiac sign. Not looking to hook up. Hit me up.

Hmu if ya wanna continue

We were at neighboring gates.  I‚Äôm from a west coast state and you were heading home to Vegas with your son. You‚Äôre both blonde. I had a specific comment about your luggage. What characters are on the luggage?!

Hi, I was at the Kings near Buckley and Smoky Hill and I hurt my back a bit and you helped put the groceries in my car.  Wished I could have given you a proper thank you but I was wincing a bit.

I commented you were eating healthy . You're beautiful !! Let's chat if u see this üëÄ

You helped me and my hubby find an eye patch for our daughter. I felt like we were vibing, and really enjoyed your energy.I have  dark hair like you. My hubby had a sleeve and you had a few tattoos yourself‚Ä¶just putting this out to the universe in hopes it finds you.

I arrived around 11 and went to bar after putting a song in for karaoke. You came up to order drink and I initiated a conversation, then got my drink and left. Al night I regretted it because you left soon after you finished your drink. I was pretty sure you were into me. And I was definitely into you: black guy with some facial hair. If you see this come back to the Outback next weekend.

You have long black hair, and a rocker-ish look. If you do read these- what color is my hair? so I know it's actually you...

You were behind the bar and made me a great drink. We chatted a bit. I said I was a little ‚Äú overdressed‚Äù and your very nice comment made me smile. This older guy would love to meet again and buy you a drink.

We met a few years back and I got to see your minivan. Then found out our kids are into the same sports and never reconnected. If you see this and are interested in reconnecting reach out.

I am a shy older man. It was October 1st early in the morning, at Uinta King Soopers.Your smile was awesome. I hope you see this, you made my day!

AB

You wanted me to bring you a rug but it started raining. We never exchanged numbers. Hit me up if you still want me to bring it by. Tell me how we met and what i keep forgetting and asking you about so i know its you.

I came in to pickup dinner in gray pants and an orange shirt.  You had Halloween leggings which showed off your amazing figure.  You also couldn‚Äôt quite say what you meant when you handed me my drink. Have a good night!

You were the rad chick who talked to me about the same Face to Face shirt. Sorry I didn‚Äôt stay to chat more. Let‚Äôs fix that.

Long shot here, but figured I‚Äôd try. I picked you up super early this morning. You were talking about how you were married and the business you do, then you hinted you might need a helping *hand* on a *job* you needed completed. I was too nervous to agree but I haven‚Äôt stopped thinking about it. Tell me what I looked like if this is you‚Ä¶

My wife and I were gambling at Monarch last night and when she walked away you made a comment about her I thought was inappropriate but now that I have thought it over I might be game for that.



Hit me up.

At St. Anthony's. I tried to give my seat to you. We both have scars. I think you're beautiful.

I deliver to where you work but never have the chance to talk to you as I'm always in a rush and you're always busy so it's a constant missed connection! Maybe this...

Why would anyone flag this? I thought this is what "missed connection" was for? Some people obviously got too much time on their hands!!

Hi Alex. I was at India Oven today but was told you are taking 2 weeks off. Will you be back there? Miss seeing you there. I go there for lunch Buffett and I like to sit away from the Buffett serving items. Sure you know me.

You helped me purchase a pair of sunglasses today. You were so very nice, and I enjoyed our conversation very much. I hesitated asking because you were at work. If by any chance you see this, I would love to take you to dinner. Have a great weekend!

I hope we can just start over.

I'll happily make your drink again.

Tuesday Arc in Loveland Woman in mustang, I was sitting with my dog. Wish I would have talked to you. Let's get together if you are interested?

First we almost bounced into each other outside the store. I should have let you go first but for some reason I went first and said sorry or something. Later we met inside the store. I helped you find the trash can. I'd love to chat more with you. Couldn't stop thinking about you this entire afternoon. Still can't.

I was pumping gas. Looked back and saw you smiling at me. You were gassing up a silver minivan with Nebraska plates. Wish I would have said hi.

I said you have beautiful hair. Wish I said more...

#7

What is my tattoo?

Did I feel a connection with you the door is open if you would be interested in stepping in. Tell me something only we would have known

So you were serving and compensated an order with orange chicken and smiled. I'd like to know you more than that! Maybe tell me where it happened and about me so I know. I just don't want to get you in trouble at work unless you don't care of course lol. I know you won't see this but tell me if I'm wrong.

I was driving north on Wadsworth at about Jewel and you were next to me in this nice black Jeep.  You were older Hispanic man and very cute. Just wanted to say hi.

We both get on at the same time and get off at the same stop.. I think you‚Äôre really cute but I can‚Äôt bring myself to speak up‚Ä¶ you walk to the 7/11 when you get off. Every morning.

I didn't get a chance to answer your question before our email chain was broken. I can't reply anymore. No more Swiss updates but one on the kid. It's a bit of a doozy.

Was behind you at Dickey's this evening (Sunday) at 4:30ish. You said you were treating yourself to dinner since the kids were at their dad's tonight. I should have chased you outside and got your number... Message me if you see this!

God I hope you see this

I was in your way while I was looking for some cheese and then you helped me look for the Havarti.  I should have given you the flowers in my basket!  If you happen to see this let me know.  I'd love to connect for an intro!

You were Traveling from Frankfurt/Germany/ to Denver, Colorado and I was going to Boston, Ma  on Sept.20, 2022.  Missed you

I know this is a long shot, I saw first sitting in the food court snd we made eye contact. You have the most beautiful eyes, then you walked behind me to the same gate. You were so stunning and beautiful, I wanted to say hello, but every time I look at you you took my breath away. As I went by you sitting in the plane, you looked up at me again and again I wanted to say hello. ÔøºÔøº I was wearing the orange shirt,Ôøº if you see this tell me what the logo was on your black shirt. I would love to get to know you! ÔøºÔøº

To the gorgeous and absolutely fit lady who was parked nose to nose from me today at the Safeway on 144th and Lowell- you know who you are.   We exchanged lingering looks and smiles but neither one of us went beyond that.  You drove away in your Audi.   Please reach out.  Tell me what I was driving!!

Saw you on CR 23. You were heading south as I was heading north. We locked eyes for a sec. You caught my attention so I pumped my brakes and you noticed. You turned back around saw me again but kept driving. You're a beautiful chocolate woman.  I hope you see this.

You were delivering packages and parked in front of my house. We had a very nice little chat and I gave you a neon vest so you could look more "legit" while delivering. I should have asked for your phone number. Lets hang out.. you can return the vest, I'm sure it's huge on you ;)

We exchanged a emails a few years ago. F4m‚Ä¶ you told me I should be at Sunday school for being in my 20s.

We both like to run and take care of ourselves which is more than most people have in common. Plus you're tall and beautiful and I'm... tall lol

I was walking home after ideal. You slowed down on your bike and told me that you thought I was cute and that you hope I have a good day. I‚Äôve never posted on here and you may never see this but I thought you were cute too and Ive never had a stranger say something so cute to me before that didn‚Äôt make me feel creeped out. Anyway. Have a good day, maybe we‚Äôll meet again and we can ride bikes together and do spooky things this season.

You we‚Äôre having trouble with your bike. In the position you were in I had to stop.  Got you good and fixed, and never asked for a number‚Ä¶doh!  Hope you see this.

Saw you smiling face. Nice and handsome. We smiled. Cheers. Wanted to say hello. Missed.

I was the man behind you in drive-thru and could see your face in your driver‚Äôs side mirror. You paid for my coffee. I couldn‚Äôt thank you because your drive away and my drink took sometime.

You were waiting in line as I was called up to get my picture taken. You gave the best flirty smile and I thought you were a very beautiful lady.. let me know what color hat and shirt I had on. It was around 1pm today..Would love to take you on a date..

Happened to see you again at King Soopers on Wednesday afternoon. You were with your kiddo so I did not want to say anything or be creepy (although I guess posting here could be considered creepy, LOL) You have shoulder length wavy blonde hair. Offer still stands from a few months ago. Let‚Äôs grab a latte. You are gorgeous.

I tried to talk to you but i kept missing the opportunity, we made eye contact a couple times, you are a sexy country girl in jeans. I am a taller guy average build. I would like to grab a beer and hang out or something if you see this.

I had door dashed at Walgreens a few nights ago. I came in and you instantly smiled and said hi. Showed me right where to go and checked me out. If you wanna talk, what did I get?

I was leaving and you were just going in just going in to Safeway we both smile at each other would love to chat.

Thursday afternoon. I was having coffee and you were with you're mom and her friend. We connected and both left the restaurant at the same time. Let's chat üôÇ

U were short with dark hair and dark eyes. Very beautiful. I was tall & scruffy. I wanted to compliment you on those eyes. But, nowadays it's hard to talk to ppl. We both waited 4ever for our food. I know it's a long shot, but wth.

I was out with a group yesterday and as we passed you said you wanted to workout with me. I couldn't really accepted a the time but I think I know why you asked. Write back with your description and which gym. I'd like to connect.

You are the stunning older woman in the workout outfit. You were loading groceries in the back of your car, we locked eyes. You made me stop in my tracks. If traffic wasn‚Äôt too bad, I would have introduced myself. I hope you see this, I hope we have a chance to talk.

Hope you see this.

This should be easy to remember. We were in the elevator at one of the DTC buildings and the elevator got stuck for 5 mins. You freaked out and I calmed you down. Happened last Tuesday. I was in business casual.Some muscles. Your are in your mid or low 30‚Äôs.

Unexpected fun until you ran away from me. Thanks for the moment.

Hey its R I'm trying to get a hold of you but lost your number if you see this send me a message

We made eye contact and I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to say Hi. I hope you see this! You are a beautiful lady!

I wanted to talk to you on OKC, but you disappeared.

You have long black hair, and a rocker-ish look. If you do read these- what color is my hair? so I know it's actually you...

You were behind the bar and made me a great drink. We chatted a bit. I said I was a little ‚Äú overdressed‚Äù and your very nice comment made me smile. This older guy would love to meet again and buy you a drink.

We met a few years back and I got to see your minivan. Then found out our kids are into the same sports and never reconnected. If you see this and are interested in reconnecting reach out.

I am a shy older man. It was October 1st early in the morning, at Uinta King Soopers.Your smile was awesome. I hope you see this, you made my day!

AB

You wanted me to bring you a rug but it started raining. We never exchanged numbers. Hit me up if you still want me to bring it by. Tell me how we met and what i keep forgetting and asking you about so i know its you.

I came in to pickup dinner in gray pants and an orange shirt.  You had Halloween leggings which showed off your amazing figure.  You also couldn‚Äôt quite say what you meant when you handed me my drink. Have a good night!

You were the rad chick who talked to me about the same Face to Face shirt. Sorry I didn‚Äôt stay to chat more. Let‚Äôs fix that.

Long shot here, but figured I‚Äôd try. I picked you up super early this morning. You were talking about how you were married and the business you do, then you hinted you might need a helping *hand* on a *job* you needed completed. I was too nervous to agree but I haven‚Äôt stopped thinking about it. Tell me what I looked like if this is you‚Ä¶

My wife and I were gambling at Monarch last night and when she walked away you made a comment about her I thought was inappropriate but now that I have thought it over I might be game for that.



Hit me up.

At St. Anthony's. I tried to give my seat to you. We both have scars. I think you're beautiful.

I deliver to where you work but never have the chance to talk to you as I'm always in a rush and you're always busy so it's a constant missed connection! Maybe this...

Why would anyone flag this? I thought this is what "missed connection" was for? Some people obviously got too much time on their hands!!

Hi Alex. I was at India Oven today but was told you are taking 2 weeks off. Will you be back there? Miss seeing you there. I go there for lunch Buffett and I like to sit away from the Buffett serving items. Sure you know me.

You helped me purchase a pair of sunglasses today. You were so very nice, and I enjoyed our conversation very much. I hesitated asking because you were at work. If by any chance you see this, I would love to take you to dinner. Have a great weekend!

I hope we can just start over.

I'll happily make your drink again.

Tuesday Arc in Loveland Woman in mustang, I was sitting with my dog. Wish I would have talked to you. Let's get together if you are interested?

First we almost bounced into each other outside the store. I should have let you go first but for some reason I went first and said sorry or something. Later we met inside the store. I helped you find the trash can. I'd love to chat more with you. Couldn't stop thinking about you this entire afternoon. Still can't.

I was pumping gas. Looked back and saw you smiling at me. You were gassing up a silver minivan with Nebraska plates. Wish I would have said hi.

I said you have beautiful hair. Wish I said more...

What is my tattoo?

Did I feel a connection with you the door is open if you would be interested in stepping in. Tell me something only we would have known

So you were serving and compensated an order with orange chicken and smiled. I'd like to know you more than that! Maybe tell me where it happened and about me so I know. I just don't want to get you in trouble at work unless you don't care of course lol. I know you won't see this but tell me if I'm wrong.

I was driving north on Wadsworth at about Jewel and you were next to me in this nice black Jeep.  You were older Hispanic man and very cute. Just wanted to say hi.

We both get on at the same time and get off at the same stop.. I think you‚Äôre really cute but I can‚Äôt bring myself to speak up‚Ä¶ you walk to the 7/11 when you get off. Every morning.

I didn't get a chance to answer your question before our email chain was broken. I can't reply anymore. No more Swiss updates but one on the kid. It's a bit of a doozy.

Was behind you at Dickey's this evening (Sunday) at 4:30ish. You said you were treating yourself to dinner since the kids were at their dad's tonight. I should have chased you outside and got your number... Message me if you see this!

God I hope you see this

I was in your way while I was looking for some cheese and then you helped me look for the Havarti.  I should have given you the flowers in my basket!  If you happen to see this let me know.  I'd love to connect for an intro!

You were Traveling from Frankfurt/Germany/ to Denver, Colorado and I was going to Boston, Ma  on Sept.20, 2022.  Missed you

I know this is a long shot, I saw first sitting in the food court snd we made eye contact. You have the most beautiful eyes, then you walked behind me to the same gate. You were so stunning and beautiful, I wanted to say hello, but every time I look at you you took my breath away. As I went by you sitting in the plane, you looked up at me again and again I wanted to say hello. ÔøºÔøº I was wearing the orange shirt,Ôøº if you see this tell me what the logo was on your black shirt. I would love to get to know you! ÔøºÔøº

To the gorgeous and absolutely fit lady who was parked nose to nose from me today at the Safeway on 144th and Lowell- you know who you are.   We exchanged lingering looks and smiles but neither one of us went beyond that.  You drove away in your Audi.   Please reach out.  Tell me what I was driving!!

Saw you on CR 23. You were heading south as I was heading north. We locked eyes for a sec. You caught my attention so I pumped my brakes and you noticed. You turned back around saw me again but kept driving. You're a beautiful chocolate woman.  I hope you see this.

You were delivering packages and parked in front of my house. We had a very nice little chat and I gave you a neon vest so you could look more "legit" while delivering. I should have asked for your phone number. Lets hang out.. you can return the vest, I'm sure it's huge on you ;)

We exchanged a emails a few years ago. F4m‚Ä¶ you told me I should be at Sunday school for being in my 20s.

We both like to run and take care of ourselves which is more than most people have in common. Plus you're tall and beautiful and I'm... tall lol

I was walking home after ideal. You slowed down on your bike and told me that you thought I was cute and that you hope I have a good day. I‚Äôve never posted on here and you may never see this but I thought you were cute too and Ive never had a stranger say something so cute to me before that didn‚Äôt make me feel creeped out. Anyway. Have a good day, maybe we‚Äôll meet again and we can ride bikes together and do spooky things this season.

You we‚Äôre having trouble with your bike. In the position you were in I had to stop.  Got you good and fixed, and never asked for a number‚Ä¶doh!  Hope you see this.

Saw you smiling face. Nice and handsome. We smiled. Cheers. Wanted to say hello. Missed.

I was the man behind you in drive-thru and could see your face in your driver‚Äôs side mirror. You paid for my coffee. I couldn‚Äôt thank you because your drive away and my drink took sometime.

You were waiting in line as I was called up to get my picture taken. You gave the best flirty smile and I thought you were a very beautiful lady.. let me know what color hat and shirt I had on. It was around 1pm today..Would love to take you on a date..

Happened to see you again at King Soopers on Wednesday afternoon. You were with your kiddo so I did not want to say anything or be creepy (although I guess posting here could be considered creepy, LOL) You have shoulder length wavy blonde hair. Offer still stands from a few months ago. Let‚Äôs grab a latte. You are gorgeous.

I tried to talk to you but i kept missing the opportunity, we made eye contact a couple times, you are a sexy country girl in jeans. I am a taller guy average build. I would like to grab a beer and hang out or something if you see this.

I had door dashed at Walgreens a few nights ago. I came in and you instantly smiled and said hi. Showed me right where to go and checked me out. If you wanna talk, what did I get?

I was leaving and you were just going in just going in to Safeway we both smile at each other would love to chat.

Thursday afternoon. I was having coffee and you were with you're mom and her friend. We connected and both left the restaurant at the same time. Let's chat üôÇ

U were short with dark hair and dark eyes. Very beautiful. I was tall & scruffy. I wanted to compliment you on those eyes. But, nowadays it's hard to talk to ppl. We both waited 4ever for our food. I know it's a long shot, but wth.

I was out with a group yesterday and as we passed you said you wanted to workout with me. I couldn't really accepted a the time but I think I know why you asked. Write back with your description and which gym. I'd like to connect.

You are the stunning older woman in the workout outfit. You were loading groceries in the back of your car, we locked eyes. You made me stop in my tracks. If traffic wasn‚Äôt too bad, I would have introduced myself. I hope you see this, I hope we have a chance to talk.

Hope you see this.

This should be easy to remember. We were in the elevator at one of the DTC buildings and the elevator got stuck for 5 mins. You freaked out and I calmed you down. Happened last Tuesday. I was in business casual.Some muscles. Your are in your mid or low 30‚Äôs.

Unexpected fun until you ran away from me. Thanks for the moment.

Hey its R I'm trying to get a hold of you but lost your number if you see this send me a message

We made eye contact and I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to say Hi. I hope you see this! You are a beautiful lady!

I wanted to talk to you on OKC, but you disappeared.

We were in paint section. I could smell your old spice deodorant. You‚Äôre scruffy and muscular, I‚Äôm just a guy with average looks.

You were taking yourself for a walk and licked my left hand in greeting. Let me know if you want to hang out sometime

You: Handsome Latino with tattoos and septum piercing.  We were both leaving at the same time on Monday 9/19 around 8:15PM.  Let me know if you see this.

Thank You

I pointed the door dash driver to your building and talked to you on the phone. You were very patient and kind. I hope he found your building.

Looking for a male friend to hang out with.

You were wearing your NASA shirt and looked so cute and intelligent. I was on a boring date, we sat in same row and stood in line next to each other. I‚Äôd like to know you.

You were the beautiful lady getting gas then putting air in her tires last night. You were in a black car and have curly hair and had on tie dye shorts.. I was in black Ford Raptor truck. We exchanged a few glances and smiles and I'm kicking myself for not saying hello.. hopefully this finds you..

If you‚Äôre you and you remember me, you‚Äôll remember what kind of guitar I bought ‚Äî put it in the subject line.

-B

You were very handsome and made me nervous, plus my dog was barking at you and I felt bad. Not sure if that was your man with you, but you were both handsome. Let‚Äôs chat if you see this.

think we caught each other's glance a couple times... you were with people but i wished you were alone so we could have chatted.

You absolutely took my breath away. We chatted some. This is a long shot, but if you see this and felt the same way, I am your man.

We had decent conversation.   I should of walked you back.  Still up?

Anyone want to make some friendly wagers on any games this season

Best wishes, Mare

You helped me pick out a gundam let me know what I look like or what gundam I got‚Ä¶ I would love to build with you sometime

We talked for a few minutes and I felt a connection.  I will be out of town for a week, so I won‚Äôt have a chance to ‚Äúrun into you‚Äù.  If you respond, I will be able to email.  Would love to get to know you better, you were very attractive and I am interested.

I'd like to reconnect...we met up a couple weeks ago and enjoyed a fun moment...ok a long moment...52yo male here...hmu if you see this...thanks

I‚Äôve never done this. I should‚Äôve asked you to out. Crossing my fingers‚Ä¶.

I should have come back to give you my phone number when I had the chance

Jon

Hanna, this is a special shoutout to you.  Not sure you're going to ever see this, but IF YOU DO, care to grab a drink sometime soon?  I must be transparent: I'm moving away at the end of the year, but think of all the fun we could have until then....

I am not sure if it was me or what I was wearing but tell me what it was and let's talk.

Bro. I kept it. and it was FIRE. -- please tell me the strain i literally think about this once a week

Sep 14 around 7:25 AM - you; golden boy shirtless runner looking incredible. thanks for the eye candy and making the walk a bit more enjoyable. Please no response unless you are this person.

You and I were racing down smoky hill towards southlands,  you turned north and waved at aurora parkway. What was I driving? Hope this finds you

-That guy

Pat - We met at right fit alterations and totally forgot to ask for your number. Never used this before but figured I‚Äôd try it! Mention something about our convo in your reply so I know it‚Äôs not some internet stranger lol.

Saw you at the bus stop today at 4:30. I was too shy to start a conversation but was checking you out. You are super cute and I should have asked you out

You and another person were at Meow Wolf today, Monday 9/12, in an adorable suspender dress. I complimented your bee purse and showed you my snail purse and called us twins. Later, we ran into each other in the Security Room and swapped tips for befriending slime. I didn't get a chance to say so but you seemed really cool and I would love to be friends. Hopefully our paths converge (see what I did there?) again.

The first time we crossed paths I was getting my Porsche checked. Today it was my truck. You made my day the first time with your smile. Today, again, you are still gorgeous. Just saying thanks for being the best part of my day.

Wished I'd have said more, you were in the BMW with the dog in the back.  Gorgeous.

We were both in are cars, smoking  cigarettes! I thought I saw you looking my way but there was a sum glair. I thought to get out and approach you but wasn‚Äôt sure until I backed up to leave and once I did you did the same and it was too late‚Ä¶.Would like a female to walk with!!

Hit me up if you know who you are.

You were there this morning in the blue shorts.  That was a beautiful showing.  Made adjustments at certain times.  Thought we'd connect?

WOW, from the moment I seen you smile I haven‚Äôt been able to get you out of my head . I highly doubt you see this but I thought you should know how beautiful you are. -J

Im the cash-app guy

You were standing in the shade. It took me about half a minute to notice you were waiting on your boyfriend to finish repairing his motorized üõµ. Although I noticed the opportunity to swoop in. Taken advantage of someone else's misfortune is in my nature but if y'all aren't dating. I would like my chance to date you. I am the tall guy who waved bye to you.

I'm looking for a date to state fair I'm a 25 year old Hispanic male I'm looking for a male or female I will pay 21+

To the beautiful absolutely stunning miss I saw today walking down main st in canyon  today wearing the pink dress, tan skin, you have my attention forsure !! I would love to see if you would be up for a date night !!!

Been kicking myself all day for not asking for your number

You were buying food but went to the wrong location. You helped me with the door. I should have bought you a tequila.

Keep getting flagged

Keep flagging. We're having more fun with your mom

Who besides me enjoys the monster dogs at Costco? Especially when you put a ton of tasty sauce on top ..

I miss talking to you. The conversations we used to have. The way you made me laugh. You are such a kind sweet man. That is what this woman really liked about you. You were always so respectful and thoughtful of me. Wish I could see you again. Hope things are well for you.

You came up to me in target gave me some line about how cute I was. I was w my little one and you leaned over whispered something to me that made me blush.....just wanted you to know I'm still thinking about it. Thanks. You really were cute.

I was in Monday night and sat at the bar. I hadn‚Äôt been there before.  You were so friendly and adorable.  I wanted to get your contact information, but it got a bit crowded and I didn‚Äôt want to do that in front of everyone. I‚Äôd like to talk more.

We flew from Eugene to Las Vegas. I went on to Santa Barbara and you went on to Colorado Springs. You were coming back from a ladies trip and are planning another road trip riding a motorcycle in the mountains. We talked all the way from EUG to LAS. This is a long long shot but would love to talk some more about your adventures. I didn‚Äôt get your name but you‚Äôre a retired educator I believe ‚Ä¶ if you read this needle in a haystack message. Please reply.

I hope to see you again.

This is a long shot, but I saw you at Dutch bros in fountain this morning. I was there with my room mate grabbing coffee from the walk up window, and you were waiting for your order from the window. You had a flight for life vest on and drove off in a pretty truck. I looked homeless in my pjs‚Ä¶ black shorts, grey sweatshirt, ponytail, and lots of tattoos. Anyways, you‚Äôre handsome and I hope you‚Äôre single!

Was at Top Golf you asked me about my best club, I told you and you were interested in learning more

We stood by each other at the Fred Again show. You told me you liked how I danced and gave me a piece of gum. Really wish I would have asked more about you.

You approached me and I looked for you later to give you my card, but I couldn‚Äôt find you.

Im a male who wae in target you were a woman looking at a tv and it took them forever to take care of you. You were in leather leggings very tight but I admired you. I kept running into you when I was about to approach you I got a call and had to run. Please reach out. We locked eyes couple times but I found you stunning Hope you see this.

We were at neighboring gates.  I‚Äôm from a west coast state and you were heading home to Vegas with your son. You‚Äôre both blonde. I had a specific comment about your luggage. What characters are on the luggage?!

Hi, I was at the Kings near Buckley and Smoky Hill and I hurt my back a bit and you helped put the groceries in my car.  Wished I could have given you a proper thank you but I was wincing a bit.

I commented you were eating healthy . You're beautiful !! Let's chat if u see this üëÄ

You helped me and my hubby find an eye patch for our daughter. I felt like we were vibing, and really enjoyed your energy.I have  dark hair like you. My hubby had a sleeve and you had a few tattoos yourself‚Ä¶just putting this out to the universe in hopes it finds you.

I arrived around 11 and went to bar after putting a song in for karaoke. You came up to order drink and I initiated a conversation, then got my drink and left. Al night I regretted it because you left soon after you finished your drink. I was pretty sure you were into me. And I was definitely into you: black guy with some facial hair.

Looking for a male friend to hang out with.

You were wearing your NASA shirt and looked so cute and intelligent. I was on a boring date, we sat in same row and stood in line next to each other. I‚Äôd like to know you.

You were the beautiful lady getting gas then putting air in her tires last night. You were in a black car and have curly hair and had on tie dye shorts.. I was in black Ford Raptor truck. We exchanged a few glances and smiles and I'm kicking myself for not saying hello.. hopefully this finds you..

If you‚Äôre you and you remember me, you‚Äôll remember what kind of guitar I bought ‚Äî put it in the subject line.

You were very handsome and made me nervous, plus my dog was barking at you and I felt bad. Not sure if that was your man with you, but you were both handsome. Let‚Äôs chat if you see this.

think we caught each other's glance a couple times... you were with people but i wished you were alone so we could have chatted.

You absolutely took my breath away. We chatted some. This is a long shot, but if you see this and felt the same way, I am your man.

We had decent conversation.   I should of walked you back.  Still up?

Anyone want to make some friendly wagers on any games this season

Best wishes, Mare

You helped me pick out a gundam let me know what I look like or what gundam I got‚Ä¶ I would love to build with you sometime

We talked for a few minutes and I felt a connection.  I will be out of town for a week, so I won‚Äôt have a chance to ‚Äúrun into you‚Äù.  If you respond, I will be able to email.  Would love to get to know you better, you were very attractive and I am interested.

I'd like to reconnect...we met up a couple weeks ago and enjoyed a fun moment...ok a long moment...52yo male here...hmu if you see this...thanks

I‚Äôve never done this. I should‚Äôve asked you to out. Crossing my fingers‚Ä¶.

You were the short black woman with her amazing backside hanging out of black or dark blue shorts. I‚Äôm an average height white/Hispanic guy. I should of said something haha

I should have come back to give you my phone number when I had the chance

Hanna, this is a special shoutout to you.  Not sure you're going to ever see this, but IF YOU DO, care to grab a drink sometime soon?  I must be transparent: I'm moving away at the end of the year, but think of all the fun we could have until then....

I am not sure if it was me or what I was wearing but tell me what it was and let's talk.

Bro. I kept it. and it was FIRE. -- please tell me the strain i literally think about this once a week

Sep 14 around 7:25 AM - you; golden boy shirtless runner looking incredible. thanks for the eye candy and making the walk a bit more enjoyable. Please no response unless you are this person.

You and I were racing down smoky hill towards southlands,  you turned north and waved at aurora parkway. What was I driving? Hope this finds you

-That guy

Pat - We met at right fit alterations and totally forgot to ask for your number. Never used this before but figured I‚Äôd try it! Mention something about our convo in your reply so I know it‚Äôs not some internet stranger lol.

Saw you at the bus stop today at 4:30. I was too shy to start a conversation but was checking you out. You are super cute and I should have asked you out

You and another person were at Meow Wolf today, Monday 9/12, in an adorable suspender dress. I complimented your bee purse and showed you my snail purse and called us twins. Later, we ran into each other in the Security Room and swapped tips for befriending slime. I didn't get a chance to say so but you seemed really cool and I would love to be friends. Hopefully our paths converge (see what I did there?) again.

The first time we crossed paths I was getting my Porsche checked. Today it was my truck. You made my day the first time with your smile. Today, again, you are still gorgeous. Just saying thanks for being the best part of my day.

Wished I'd have said more, you were in the BMW with the dog in the back.  Gorgeous.

We were both in are cars, smoking  cigarettes! I thought I saw you looking my way but there was a sum glair. I thought to get out and approach you but wasn‚Äôt sure until I backed up to leave and once I did you did the same and it was too late‚Ä¶.
